Data Access
***********

Here are the various ways that APOGEE data can be accessed.

Summary Files
-------------

Catalogs of summary information are available here:

`allStar-daily-apo25m.fits <https://data.sdss5.org/sas/sdsswork/mwm/apogee/spectro/redux/daily/summary/allStar-daily-apo25m.fits>`_

`allVisit-daily-apo25m.fits <https://data.sdss5.org/sas/sdsswork/mwm/apogee/spectro/redux/daily/summary/allVisit-daily-apo25m.fits>`_

The allStar file has summary information for each star, while the allVisit file has summary information for each star visit.

SAS Access
----------

All of the data files can be accessed directly from the Utah server by logging in or by using the SAS webpage online.  This is the
base directory for the daily reduction:
`daily directory <https://data.sdss5.org/sas/sdsswork/mwm/apogee/spectro/redux/daily/>`_

Note, you need the sdss username and password to access the data online.

See the `data <data.html>`_ for more information about the data products and directory structure.

Database
--------

A lot of information is stored in the APOGEE data database ``apogeedb``.  This can be queried by users that are logged into the
Utah servers.  We are working on tools for offsite access.

The 13 tables are:
- plan: Information for each plan file.
- exposure: Information on all exposures.
- visit: Summary information for each visit spectrum.
- visit_latest: The latest information for each visit spectrum.
- star: Summary information for each unique star.
- star_latest: The latest information for each star.
- rv_visit: RV summary information for each visit spectrum.
- version: The reduction versions.

These 5 tables gives the status of the different processing steps:
- exposure_status: Status of exposure processing.
- daily_status: Status of the daily reduction.
- calib_status: Status of the calibration processing.
- visit_status: Status of visit processes at the plan level.
- rv_status: Status of RV processing.
  
The layout of the tables are available here:
